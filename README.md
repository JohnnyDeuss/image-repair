# Image repair

A program that can repair damaged images by using example areas to extrapolate
what the damaged area should look like. This tool is based on Hirani 1996 and
uses Fourier transform to clone texture while maintaining shading and color.

## Examples

A knitted pattern with damage before and after repair.
